<summary>Step 1: Install Java</summary>

1. Download and install JRE from [Open Logic official website](https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads).  
   <span style="color:gray">JDK and JRE have differences. JDK (Java Development Kit) includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Java development tools. On the other hand, JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is the environment required to run Java programs. If you only want to run Java programs, you only need to install the JRE. However, if you wish to develop Java programs, you must install the JDK.</span>
   - Select the version needed for Neo4j. We use JAVA 11. Select to download the msi file.  
      1. Open the downloaded .msi file.
      2. Install JRE following the instructions and keep notes of your installation path.
